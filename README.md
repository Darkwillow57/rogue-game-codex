# rogue-game-codex

This repository contains a minimal roguelike game written in Python. The game uses the `curses` module and runs in a terminal, so it is compatible with Android Termux as well as most Unix-like systems.

## How to play

1. Ensure Python is installed in your Termux environment.
2. Run the game with:

```bash
python3 rogue.py
```

3. Use the arrow keys to move the `@` symbol around the map.
4. Collect `*` items that appear randomly. New items will spawn as you collect them.
5. Press `q` to quit the game.

Have fun!
